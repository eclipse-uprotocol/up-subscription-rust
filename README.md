# up-subscription-rust

uSubscription service written in Rust

## Implementation Status

This codebase is heavily work in progress - among the next things to do and investigate:

- [x] extend test coverage, especially for the backend subscription management and notification handler
- [x] make size of command channels bounded and (probably) configurable
- [x] handling of startup and proper shutdown for usubscription service
- [ ] look into recent up-rust changes around Rpc and UTransport implementations, and whether we can  use something from there
- [x] add github CI pipeline setup
- [x] create a usubscription-cli module, a simple command-line frontend for running up-subscription
- [ ] create a little demo application for interacting with up-subscription
- [x] set up a devcontainer
- [ ] feed back learnings and clarifications into up-spec usubscription documentation

## Implementation questions

- Is it expected that a uEntity can register more than one custom topic receiving update notifications?
- Is it supposed to be possible to register remote uuris as notification topics?
- Should remote UUris be excluded from all listeners except `subscribe` and `unsubscribe`?

## Getting Started

### Working with the library

`up-subscription-rust` is pluggable regarding which `uTransport` and `RpcClient` implementation it uses; you can provide any implementation of these up-rust traits for up-subscription to work with.

At the moment, running up-subscription involves the following steps:

1. Instantiate the UTransport and RpcClient implementations you want to use
   - the UTransport is used for sending of subscription change notifications, as well as for returning service responses via the command listeners
   - the RpcClient is used for interacting with remote usubscription instances, when dealing with subscriptions for remote topics
2. Call `USubscriptionServce::run()`, providing the UTransport and RpcClient implementations
   - this requires a `USubscriptionConfiguration` object, which carries the UTransport and RpcClient references, as well as any other available USubscription configuration options
   - this directly spawns two tasks for managing subscriptions and dealing with the sending of subscription update notifications, respectively
   - it returns both an immutable (Arc) handle to the USubscription service, as well as a `USubscriptionStopper` object that can be used to shut the USusbcription service down in an orderly manner
3. Calling `USubscriptionService::now_listen()` USubscription service object from step #2 will set up and connect a complete set of RPC listeners, connecting the USubscription service with the provided UTransport
4. VÃ³ila, you should have a working usubscription service up and running

### Using the up-subscription-cli frontend

For a batteries-included approach to running up-subscription-rust, the `up-subscription-cli` module provides a command line frontend for running the USubscription service. `up-subscription-cli` offers the customary range of settings and features, to get usage information run

```console
up-subscription-cli -h
```

Note: After `cargo build`ing the up-subscription-rust projects, the `up-subscription-cli` build artifact is usually located in the `./target/debug/` folder in your workspace. Alternatively, you can directly do `cargo run -- <parameters>` from you workspace root - for example, to build and run `up-subscription-cli` with zenoh transport and giving verbose output, use

```console
cargo run --features zenoh -- -t zenoh -a usubscription.local -v
```

`up-subscription-cli` can be used with any uProtocol rust transport implementation - the available options are controlled as cargo features, refer to the definitions in the `[features]` section of up-subscription-cli `Cargo.toml`. Currently supported are [zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-zenoh-rust) and [socket](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-socket) transports, with [mqtt](https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-transport-mqtt5-rust) to follow as soon as they move over to using the up-rust release version from crates.io.

### Running with docker

The `up-subscription-cli` also can be built and run using docker and docker-compose. The top-level `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` are provided for that purpose. `up-subscription-cli` can be provided with configuration parameters both via cli arguments, as well as environment variables. For reference on these, please refer to `docker-compose.yaml`. Please note that this configuration is provided mainly for demonstration purposes - for a production deployment, you want to revisit e.g. the network settings used by the container.

To build the container, in the project root run

```console
docker build -t up-subscription .
```

To run (and auto-build if required) the container, in the project root run

```console
docker-compose up
```
